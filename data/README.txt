This folder contains all of the comparator data that is used in the Jazz project match adjusted indirect comparisons (MAICs)
Each comparator has a folder with the folder name structured like "comparator-author"
Some of the folders have a "2" or "2L" at the end. These are duplicates to perform sensitivity analyses in MAICs.
For example, the ASC-Lamarca-etal and the ASC-Lamarca-etal-2L are the same, but in analysis outputs, the "2L" version only includes second line patients from the HERIZON-BTC cohort. 
The "BTC_ITC_data_extraction.xlsx" spreadsheet is where all the extracted characteristics for each comparator are stored.
Should a new comparator be added, it should be added to the spreadsheet and then a new folder created in the exact same structure as the others.
